# BIM-Track-OAuth

The project has the necessary code to authenticate a BIM Track user using OAuth2.0 and get a access-token from the user and send an API Call on this behalf.

The boilerplate code for Oauth2.0 is referenced from [googlesamples/oauth-apps-for-windows](https://github.com/googlesamples/oauth-apps-for-windows/tree/master/OAuthDesktopApp)

The [following article](https://help.bimtrack.co/hc/en-ca/articles/360060182352-Using-OAuth-2-0) by BIM Track provides basic details of the steps you need to follow to get started with BIM Track Authentication.

> Note that the "Client_ID" & "Secret" of your app will be provided by BIM Track once you reach out to them
